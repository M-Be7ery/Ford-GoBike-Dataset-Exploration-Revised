# Ford-GoBike-Dataset-Exploration-Revised
In this investigation of the Ford GoBike System, I wanted to look at the riding habit/pattern for the number of trips and trips duration with respect to time and rider gender, type, and age.
The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in feb, 2019.
